Ahmad Nauval Syahputra is a college student at Brawijaya University. He is a handsome man. Which is interested in mobile Android kernel system development. He had a gaming habit for one game, named Mobile Legends. His achievements are having two accounts that have ranked in the same tier as Mythical Glory players with more than fifty stars.

Any encouragement in collaboration in game design and web development. I am currently interested in Golang Programming Language. He will help you with your Linux problems because he is a Linux enthusiast. Helping each other is a motto because it helps motivate us as social people.
